# Stunts.Package Readme

Building this project will create a .nupkg containing just this Readme file. 

It's always a good idea to provide a more useful package to your users, 
alongside a nice descriptive Readme like this one that will open automatically
when they add your package to a project.

Happy nugetizing!
