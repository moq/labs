  <!-- Because our analyzers are intended to be design-time only, 
       we cannot just include them in the package `analyzer` folder.
       Instead, we have to use an alternative mechanism that only 
       adds them for VS. The chosen hook is to check for the DesignTimeBuild 
       property which is passed by VS to the project when retrieving the 
       analyers to run as part of the design-time build only. -->
